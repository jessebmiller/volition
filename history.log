*   **Tool Safety:** How are tools like `shell` and `write_file` implemented? Is user confirmation required? (Look into `src/tools.rs`)
*   **Dependency Audit:** Check for known vulnerabilities (`cargo audit`).
*   **Error Handling:** Further examine error handling, especially in `api.rs` and `tools.rs`.
*   **Build/Deployment:** Any Dockerfile, CI/CD configuration, or release build settings?
*   **Logging:** Review the detail and usefulness of current logging.
*   **State File Location:** Move `.conversation_state.json` to a better location.

Now, let's continue the audit by looking into **Tool Safety**. The tools, especially `shell` and `write_file`, have the potential to be destructive if not handled carefully. We need to examine `src/tools.rs` to see how they are implemented and if there are sufficient safeguards, like user confirmation.
