1. Core Agent Interface:

• pub struct Agent: The main entry point for using the library's core functionality.
• impl Agent:
  • pub fn new(config: RuntimeConfig, tool_provider: Arc<dyn ToolProvider>) -> Result<Self>
    : Constructor, takes validated configuration and a tool provider implementation.
  • pub async fn run(&self, goal: &str, working_dir: &Path) -> Result<AgentOutput>
    : The primary method to execute an AI task, orchestrating model calls and tool usage.
• pub struct AgentOutput: The structured result returned by Agent::run, containing tool results and the final AI state/message. (Fields suggested_summary,
  applied_tool_results, final_state_description are public).
• pub struct ToolExecutionResult: Represents the outcome of a single tool execution within AgentOutput. (Fields tool_call_id, tool_name, input, output,
  status are public).
• pub enum ToolExecutionStatus: Simple enum (Success, Failure) used in ToolExecutionResult.

*** Does agent output contain the full message history or just the final message from the AI? ***
*** What are suggested_summary, applied_tool_results, and final_state_description? what are they used for? ***
*** I would expect the output of an agent run to be the message history (which include the tool calls and results) Not sure what else there woudl be ***

2. Tool Provider Abstraction (Extension Point):

• #[async_trait] pub trait ToolProvider: Send + Sync: The central trait consumers must implement to provide tools to the Agent.
  • fn get_tool_definitions(&self) -> Vec<ToolDefinition>: Method to provide the schema of available tools.
  • async fn execute_tool(...) -> Result<String>: Method to execute a requested tool and return its output as a string.
• pub struct ToolDefinition: Struct defining a tool's schema for the AI (name, description, parameters). (Fields public).
• pub struct ToolParametersDefinition: Defines the parameters object within ToolDefinition. (Fields public).
• pub struct ToolParameter: Defines a single parameter's type and description. (Fields public).
• pub enum ToolParameterType: Defines allowed parameter types (String, Integer, etc.).
• pub struct ToolInput: Wrapper for the arguments (HashMap<String, JsonValue>) passed to ToolProvider::execute_tool. (Field public).

*** so a ToolProvider can provide multiple tools? if so how is a tool selected for execute_tool? ***

3. Configuration:

• pub struct RuntimeConfig: Holds validated configuration (system prompt, selected model key, model map, API key). (Fields public).
• pub struct ModelConfig: Holds configuration for a specific model (name, endpoint, parameters). (Fields public).
• impl RuntimeConfig:
  • pub fn selected_model_config(&self) -> Result<&ModelConfig>: Helper to get the config for the currently selected model.
• pub fn parse_and_validate_config(config_toml_content: &str, api_key: String) -> Result<RuntimeConfig>: The function responsible for parsing a TOML string
  and validating the configuration structure and values. This is the intended way to create a RuntimeConfig.

*** parse_and_validate_config seems a little verbose but if this idiomatic in the rust community lets keep it ***
*** passing in a toml string is maybe a little clunky for a client implementor? what do other libraries do? ***

4. Standard Tools Module (volition_agent_core::tools::*)

• pub mod tools: The module itself.
• pub struct CommandOutput: Structured result from command execution tools (status, stdout, stderr). (Fields public).
  • impl CommandOutput { pub fn success(&self) -> bool }: Helper method.
  • Critique: pub fn format_for_ai(...) - This helper seems misplaced. Formatting the output string for the AI should likely be the responsibility of the
    ToolProvider implementation when it returns the Result<String> from execute_tool, not a method on the core CommandOutput struct itself.
• pub async fn tools::shell::execute_shell_command(...) -> Result<CommandOutput>
• pub async fn tools::cargo::execute_cargo_command(...) -> Result<CommandOutput>
• pub async fn tools::git::execute_git_command(...) -> Result<CommandOutput>
• pub async fn tools::search::search_text(...) -> Result<String>
• pub async fn tools::search::find_rust_definition(...) -> Result<String>
• pub async fn tools::fs::read_file(...) -> Result<String>
• pub async fn tools::fs::write_file(...) -> Result<String>
• pub fn tools::fs::list_directory_contents(...) -> Result<String>
• Critique/Clarification: Are these public tool functions intended for direct use by consumers, or primarily as building blocks for ToolProvider
  implementations? Making them public allows reuse, but requires consumers to understand they lack safety checks/user interaction. This should be clearly
  documented.

*** I agree with your critiues, let's remove format_for_ai and leave it to the ToolProvider implementation, and clearly document the lack of safety checks ***

5. API/Model Interaction Structs (Lower Level):

• pub use models::chat::{ApiResponse, Choice, ChatMessage}: These structs represent the data exchanged with the underlying LLM API. Making them public is
  useful for consumers who might want to inspect raw responses or build custom logic around the API interaction.
• pub use models::tools::{ToolCall, ToolFunction}: Structs representing the AI's request to call a tool. Public for similar reasons to the chat structs.

6. Re-exports:

• pub use async_trait::async_trait;: Convenience re-export for implementing ToolProvider.

Evaluation Summary & Potential Changes:

• Core Agent API (Agent, AgentOutput, ToolProvider): Seems solid and provides the main interaction point.
• Configuration: Decoupled loading from the core library is good. parse_and_validate_config is the clear entry point here.
• Standard Tools:
  • Returning CommandOutput from shell/cargo/git is a good improvement for robustness.
  • The public nature of tools::*::execute_* functions is acceptable for reusability, but needs documentation regarding safety checks.
  • Proposal: Remove CommandOutput::format_for_ai. Let ToolProvider implementations handle formatting the CommandOutput fields into the final string result
    for execute_tool. This makes the core CommandOutput struct purely about the execution result, not presentation.
• API Structs: Keeping them public seems reasonable for flexibility and testing.
