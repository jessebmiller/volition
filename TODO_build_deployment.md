# TODO: Build and Deployment Improvements

## Issue: Lack of Automated Build/Deployment Configuration

The project currently lacks configuration for containerization and automated builds/deployments.

*   No `Dockerfile` was found.
*   No CI/CD pipeline configuration files (e.g., `.github/workflows/`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`) were found.
*   Builds likely rely on manual `cargo build` commands.

This makes deployments less repeatable, consistent, and more manual.

## Recommendations

1.  **Containerization:**
    *   Create a `Dockerfile` to build and package the application into a container image.
    *   Use a multi-stage build to keep the final image small (build stage with Rust toolchain, final stage with only the compiled binary and necessary assets).
    *   Ensure the container runs the application securely (e.g., non-root user).

2.  **CI/CD Pipeline:**
    *   Implement a CI/CD pipeline using a platform like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.
    *   The pipeline should automate:
        *   Running tests (`cargo test`).
        *   Running linters (`cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy`).
        *   Running security audits (`cargo audit`).
        *   Building the application (`cargo build --release`).
        *   Building the Docker image (if applicable).
        *   (Optional) Deploying the application to staging/production environments.
