# Strategies

Would be great to have a strategies abstraction

This would allow us to implment various ways of coding.

Examples:
- simple chat: user input -> agent run -> repeat
- TDD: user input -> prompt to write tests -> prompt to make tests pass -> repeat
- red green refactor: user input -> write tests -> pass tests -> refactor -> repeat
- plan, revise, execute: user input -> planning step -> revision -> plan good enough? -> execute or back to planning step -> repeat

future possibilities
- simulated annealing?!?
