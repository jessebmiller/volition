## üåü Overview

Volition is an open-source, Rust-specialized AI coding assistant that
empowers developers to interact with their codebase through natural
language. Built with a focus on flexibility and extensibility,
Volition supports multiple AI providers and interaction strategies.

> ‚ö† **Early Development Warning**: Volition is in the experimental
  stage. It currently lacks comprehensive safety measures and is
  intended for development use only. Use at your own risk.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Rust Specialized**: Optimized for Rust development workflows with deep understanding of Rust idioms and patterns
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Compatible with various LLM providers (Google, OpenAI, Ollama, etc.)
- **Strategy Pattern Architecture**: Flexible interaction models including PlanExecute and CompleteTask strategies
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol) First**: Native support for the emerging MCP standard
- **CLI + Library Separation**: Use as a command-line tool or integrate the core library into your applications
- **Free and Open Source**: Licensed under Apache 2.0

## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (1.70+ recommended)
- For non-local models: API keys for your preferred provider(s), set as environment variables (e.g., `GEMINI_API_KEY`).

### From crates.io (Recommended)

Once published, you can install the command-line tool directly from crates.io:

```bash
cargo install volition-cli --locked
```

This will make the volition command and the associated
volition-*-server binaries available in your environment (typically in
$HOME/.cargo/bin, ensure this directory is in your system's
PATH). Using --locked ensures you use the exact dependency versions
tested for the release.

### From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jessebmiller/volition.git
cd volition

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Optional: Install the binary and servers locally from source
cargo install --path volition-cli
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Configuration

Create a `Volition.toml` file in your project root:

```toml
default_provider = "gemini"

system_prompt = """
You are Volition, an AI-powered Rust engineering assistant.
Your goal is to help the user understand, modify, and improve their Rust codebase.
Always follow Rust best practices and idioms.
"""

[providers]
  [providers.gemini]
  type = "gemini"
  # Make sure the environment variable below is set in your envionment or a .env file
  api_key_env_var = "GEMINI_API_KEY"
  [providers.gemini.model_config]
    model_name = "gemini-1.5-pro"
    endpoint = "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-pro:generateContent"
    parameters = { temperature = 0.7 }

[mcp_servers]
  # See note below on MCP Server Paths for more information
  [mcp_servers.filesystem]
  command = "volition-filesystem-server"
  [mcp_servers.git]
  command = "volition-git-server"
  [mcp_servers.search]
  command = "volition-search-server"
  [mcp_servers.shell]
  command = "volition-shell-server"


[strategies]
  [strategies.plan_execute]
  planning_provider = "gemini"
  execution_provider = "gemini"
```

#### Note on MCP Server Paths:

- The command paths under [mcp_servers] tell Volition how to launch the tools it needs (like filesystem access, git operations, etc.).
- If you installed using cargo install volition-cli, the server binaries (volition-filesystem-server, volition-git-server, etc.) are placed alongside the main volition binary, typically in $HOME/.cargo/bin/.
- If $HOME/.cargo/bin is in your system's PATH environment variable (which is common for Rust setups), you can often just use the command name directly (e.g., command = "volition-filesystem-server") as shown in the example above.
- If it's not in your PATH or you need specific paths, provide the full absolute path (e.g., command = "/path/to/your/.cargo/bin/volition-filesystem-server").
- If running from a source checkout (using cargo run), you would use relative paths to the build output, like command = "target/debug/volition-filesystem-server".
- Future versions may include automatic server discovery or management to simplify this setup.

### Usage

Ensure your API keys are set as environment variables or are set in a
.env file. These variable names are configured in Volition.toml (e.g.,
export GEMINI_API_KEY). Volition.toml should be located in the current
directory or a parent directory.

Interactive mode:

```bash
volition
```

Single task mode:

```bash
volition --task "Implement proper error handling in src/main.rs"
```

Enable verbose logging:

```bash
volition -v  # Info level
volition -vv  # Debug level
volition -vvv  # Trace level
```

## üß© Architecture

Volition is built with a modular architecture:

- **volition-cli**: Command-line interface
- **volition-core**: Core agent library with providers, strategies, and tools
- (Individual server crates also exist in the workspace but are built/installed via volition-cli)

## üõ† Development

### Building the Project

```bash
# Build all components
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run with development features
cargo run -p volition-cli -- [ARGS]
```

### Server Components

The MCP servers are separate binaries. When running the CLI via `cargo
run -p volition-cli`, it may not automatically find the server
binaries unless they are built and their paths are configured
correctly in a development `Volition.toml` (e.g., pointing to
`target/debug/volition-filesystem-server`).

You can also run servers manually for testing if needed.

```bash
cargo run -p volition-filesystem-server
cargo run -p volition-git-server
cargo run -p volition-search-server
cargo run -p volition-shell-server
```
