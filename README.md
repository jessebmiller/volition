## üåü Overview

Volition is an open-source, Rust-specialized AI coding assistant that empowers developers to interact with their codebase through natural language. Built with a focus on flexibility and extensibility, Volition supports multiple AI providers and interaction strategies.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Early Development Warning**: Volition is in the experimental stage. It currently lacks comprehensive safety measures and is intended for development use only. Use at your own risk.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Rust Specialized**: Optimized for Rust development workflows with deep understanding of Rust idioms and patterns
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Compatible with various LLM providers (Google, OpenAI, Ollama, etc.)
- **Strategy Pattern Architecture**: Flexible interaction models including PlanExecute and CompleteTask strategies
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol) First**: Native support for the emerging MCP standard
- **CLI + Library Separation**: Use as a command-line tool or integrate the core library into your applications
- **Free and Open Source**: Licensed under Apache 2.0

## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (1.70+)
- For non-local models: API keys for your preferred provider(s)

### From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/username/volition.git
cd volition

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Optional: Install the binary
cargo install --path volition-cli
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Configuration

Create a `Volition.toml` file in your project root:

```toml
# Default AI provider to use
default_provider = "gemini"

# System prompt that defines Volition's behavior
system_prompt = """
You are Volition, an AI-powered Rust engineering assistant.
Your goal is to help the user understand, modify, and improve their Rust codebase.
Always follow Rust best practices and idioms.
"""

# --- AI Model Providers ---
[providers]
  [providers.gemini]
  type = "gemini"
  api_key_env_var = "GEMINI_API_KEY"
  [providers.gemini.model_config]
    model_name = "gemini-1.5-pro"
    endpoint = "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-pro:generateContent"
    parameters = { temperature = 0.7 }

# --- MCP Tool Servers ---
[mcp_servers]
  [mcp_servers.filesystem]
  command = "/path/to/volition-filesystem-server"
  [mcp_servers.git]
  command = "/path/to/volition-git-server"
  [mcp_servers.search]
  command = "/path/to/volition-search-server"
  [mcp_servers.shell]
  command = "/path/to/volition-shell-server"

# --- Strategy Configurations ---
[strategies]
  [strategies.plan_execute]
  planning_provider = "gemini"
  execution_provider = "gemini"
```

### Usage

Interactive mode:

```bash
volition
```

Single task mode:

```bash
volition --task "Implement proper error handling in src/main.rs"
```

Enable verbose logging:

```bash
volition -v  # Info level
volition -vv  # Debug level
volition -vvv  # Trace level
```

## üß© Architecture

Volition is built with a modular architecture:

- **volition-cli**: Command-line interface
- **volition-agent-core**: Core agent library with providers, strategies, and tools
- **volition-*-server**: MCP server implementations for different tool domains

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Building the Project

```bash
# Build all components
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run with development features
cargo run -p volition-cli
```

### Server Components

Start the MCP servers manually for development:

```bash
cargo run -p volition-filesystem-server
cargo run -p volition-git-server
cargo run -p volition-search-server
cargo run -p volition-shell-server
```
