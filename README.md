## üåü Overview

Volition is an open-source, Rust-specialized AI coding assistant that
empowers developers to interact with their codebase through natural
language. Built with a focus on flexibility and extensibility,
Volition supports multiple AI providers and interaction strategies.

> ‚ö† **Early Development Warning**: Volition is in the experimental
  stage. It currently lacks comprehensive safety measures and is
  intended for development use only. Use at your own risk.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Rust Specialized**: Optimized for Rust development workflows with deep understanding of Rust idioms and patterns
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Compatible with various LLM providers (Google, OpenAI, Ollama, etc.)
- **Strategy Pattern Architecture**: Flexible interaction models including PlanExecute and CompleteTask strategies
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol) First**: Native support for the emerging MCP standard
- **CLI + Library Separation**: Use as a command-line tool or integrate the core library into your applications
- **Project-Scoped History**: Conversation history is stored within your project directory.
- **Free and Open Source**: Licensed under Apache 2.0

## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (1.70+ recommended)
- For non-local models: API keys for your preferred provider(s), set as environment variables (e.g., `GEMINI_API_KEY`).

### From crates.io (Recommended)

Once published, you can install the command-line tool and the required MCP servers directly from crates.io. You need to install the main CLI first, followed by the servers:

```bash
# Install the main Volition CLI
cargo install volition-cli --locked

# Install the required MCP servers
cargo install volition-filesystem-server --locked
cargo install volition-git-server --locked
cargo install volition-search-server --locked
cargo install volition-shell-server --locked
```

These commands will make the `volition` command and the associated
`volition-*-server` binaries available in your Cargo binary path (typically
`$HOME/.cargo/bin`). Ensure this directory is included in your system's
`PATH` environment variable. Using `--locked` ensures you use the exact dependency versions
tested for the release.

### From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jessebmiller/volition.git
cd volition

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Optional: Install the CLI and servers locally from the built source
# This makes 'volition' and the servers available in $HOME/.cargo/bin
cargo install --path volition-cli
cargo install --path volition-filesystem-server
cargo install --path volition-git-server
cargo install --path volition-search-server
cargo install --path volition-shell-server
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Configuration

Create a `Volition.toml` file in your project root:

```toml
default_provider = "gemini"

system_prompt = """
You are Volition, an AI-powered Rust engineering assistant.
Your goal is to help the user understand, modify, and improve their Rust codebase.
Always follow Rust best practices and idioms.
"""

[providers]
  [providers.gemini]
  type = "gemini"
  # Make sure the environment variable below is set in your envionment or a .env file
  api_key_env_var = "GEMINI_API_KEY"
  [providers.gemini.model_config]
    model_name = "gemini-1.5-pro"
    endpoint = "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-pro:generateContent"
    parameters = { temperature = 0.7 }

[mcp_servers]
  # See note below on MCP Server Paths for more information
  [mcp_servers.filesystem]
  command = "volition-filesystem-server"
  [mcp_servers.git]
  command = "volition-git-server"
  [mcp_servers.search]
  command = "volition-search-server"
  [mcp_servers.shell]
  command = "volition-shell-server"


[strategies]
  [strategies.plan_execute]
  planning_provider = "gemini"
  execution_provider = "gemini"
```

**Important:** Volition now stores conversation history in a `.volition/history/` directory within your project root. It's recommended to add `.volition/` to your project's `.gitignore` file to prevent committing history files.

```gitignore
# .gitignore
.volition/
```

#### Note on MCP Server Paths:

- The `command` paths under `[mcp_servers]` tell Volition how to launch the tools it needs (like filesystem access, git operations, etc.).
- If you installed the CLI and servers using `cargo install <crate_name>` (from crates.io) or `cargo install --path <crate_path>` (from source), the server binaries (`volition-filesystem-server`, `volition-git-server`, etc.) are placed in your Cargo binary path, typically `$HOME/.cargo/bin/`, alongside the main `volition` binary.
- If `$HOME/.cargo/bin` is in your system's `PATH` environment variable (which is common for Rust setups), you can often just use the command name directly (e.g., `command = "volition-filesystem-server"`) as shown in the example above.
- If it's not in your `PATH` or you need specific paths, provide the full absolute path (e.g., `command = "/path/to/your/.cargo/bin/volition-filesystem-server"`).
- If running from a source checkout (using `cargo run`), you would use relative paths to the build output, like `command = "target/debug/volition-filesystem-server"`.
- Future versions may include automatic server discovery or management to simplify this setup.

### Usage

Ensure your API keys are set as environment variables or are set in a
`.env` file. These variable names are configured in `Volition.toml` (e.g.,
`export GEMINI_API_KEY`). `Volition.toml` should be located in the current
directory or a parent directory.

**Starting a New Conversation:**

*   **Interactive Chat:**
    ```bash
    volition
    ```
    (Starts a new interactive session. History is saved in `.volition/history/`. Type `exit` or press Enter on an empty line to quit. Type `new` to discard the current session and start fresh within the project.)

*   **Single Turn (Non-interactive):**
    ```bash
    volition --turn "Refactor the error handling in src/main.rs"
    ```
    (Runs a single query, prints the response, and exits. Creates a new conversation history in `.volition/history/`.)

**Managing Conversations (within the current project):**

*   **List Recent Conversations:**
    ```bash
    volition list
    volition list -l 5  # List the last 5
    ```

*   **View a Specific Conversation:**
    ```bash
    volition view <CONVERSATION_ID>
    volition view <CONVERSATION_ID> --full  # Show full message content
    ```
    (Replace `<CONVERSATION_ID>` with the actual ID from `volition list`)

*   **Resume an Interactive Conversation:**
    ```bash
    volition resume <CONVERSATION_ID>
    ```

*   **Resume with a Single Turn (Non-interactive):**
    ```bash
    volition resume <CONVERSATION_ID> --turn "Based on our previous discussion, add documentation."
    ```

*   **Delete a Conversation:**
    ```bash
    volition delete <CONVERSATION_ID>
    ```
    (Prompts for confirmation before deleting)

**Logging:**

Enable more detailed logging using the `-v` flag.

```bash
volition -v list         # Info level
volition -vv resume <ID> # Debug level
volition -vvv --turn ... # Trace level (most verbose)
```
Logs are printed to stderr and also saved to a file (typically `volition-app.log` in your system's temporary directory).

## üß© Architecture

Volition is built with a modular architecture:

- **volition-cli**: Command-line interface
- **volition-core**: Core agent library with providers, strategies, and tools
- **volition-*-server**: Individual MCP server crates (e.g., `volition-filesystem-server`). These must be installed separately from `volition-cli`.

## üõ† Development

### Building the Project

```bash
# Build all components
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run the CLI from source (ensure Volition.toml points to target/debug servers)
cargo run -p volition-cli -- [ARGS]
# Example:
# cargo run -p volition-cli -- list -l 3
```

### Server Components

The MCP servers are separate binaries. When running the CLI via `cargo
run -p volition-cli`, it may not automatically find the server
binaries unless they are built and their paths are configured
correctly in a development `Volition.toml` (e.g., pointing to
`target/debug/volition-filesystem-server`).

You can also run servers manually for testing if needed.

```bash
cargo run -p volition-filesystem-server
cargo run -p volition-git-server
cargo run -p volition-search-server
cargo run -p volition-shell-server
```
